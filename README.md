# musicRecognize

This program can detect music used in a video file. It use ffmpeg to transform the video file and Shazam API to detect musics.

It seems to YouTube's ContentID detection but only for music.

You have to put ffmpeg and ffprobe binaries in bin/ffmpeg folder (Windows only).
Also it requires an API Key to use Shazam API (https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam).
